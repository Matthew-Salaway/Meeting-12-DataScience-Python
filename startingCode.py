# Copy this code into your own repl. Click the navigation bar in the top left corner and go to My Repl.
# Click the New Repl on the left, create the repl, and paste the code. Or put into another IDE.

# Today we will be having a review over the fundamentals of python needed for data science. (and some statistics)

# Basic python is needed for cleaning data, exploratory data analysis, and modeling.
# It is also needed to collect data if a preset database is not available.

# Looking at the flow chart: the processes from data collection to evaluation will
# utilize basic python and modules. This will be a lesson on basic python... Modules later!

# Who remembers how to print to the terminal? Try it below!


# Now try creating a variable - one of each type (int, double, boolean)





# Now print one of the variables in context! (ex. "[color] is my favorite color")



# There are many ways to modify variables. In data science we have to find how that modification
# will help when analyzing the data. Most of the time we will modify Ints & Doubles.

# Say we have 3 numbers and want to find the average. Lets first hard code this, then use a function.
num1 = 67464
num2 = 44.873
num3 = -1234




# Now lets create a function that takes three numbers and finds the average.

# Here is a function we created in meeting #9 to help you with syntax.
def customizedHello(name, age):
    print("Hello " + name + ". You are age: " + str(age))
    #customizedHello("Matthew", 18)

# Since repl is not very good at computing in terms of speed, everyone should download an IDE like pycharm
# We will all code in repl and then copy the code into the IDE.

# We should also quickly go over a few important statistics concepts:
# https://towardsdatascience.com/the-5-basic-statistics-concepts-data-scientists-need-to-know-2c96740377ae

# Programming requires problem solving. Knowing how to complete an objective is much more
# important than memorizing how to do it. You can always look up the proper syntax, or how to execute something.
